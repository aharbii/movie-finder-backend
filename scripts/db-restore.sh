# =============================================================================
# db-restore.sh — Restore a plain-SQL backup into the local PostgreSQL database.
#
# Usage (via Makefile):
#   make db-restore FILE=backups/db_2026-04-04_12-00-00.sql
#
# Usage (direct):
#   sh scripts/db-restore.sh backups/db_2026-04-04_12-00-00.sql
#
# Safety guarantees:
#   - Never drops or truncates existing tables — data is only ADDED, not replaced.
#   - Schema creation errors ("relation already exists") are ignored so restoring
#     into a database that is already partially migrated always succeeds.
#   - Duplicate rows are skipped silently (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING in
#     the backup file — requires a backup produced by db-backup.sh).
#   - If the postgres container is not running the script exits with an error
#     before touching the database.
